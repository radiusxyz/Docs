# Roadmap

#### 1. **SBB 2.0 - Backrunning on Single Rollup**

SBB 2.0 enables searchers to submit backrunning bundles directly to rollups. This allows rollups and searchers to capture arbitrage opportunities, including CEX-DEX arbitrage.

* **Q1 2025:** Integration on rollup testnet
* **Q2 2025:** Integration on rollup mainnet

#### **2. Lighthouse 1.0 - Expanding Across Rollups**

Lighthouse 1.0 connects a network of multiple rollups and searchers for good MEV capture. Rollups earn revenue from these bids by executing arbitrage bundles from searchers.

* **Q2 2025:** Testnet launch
* **Q4 2025:** Mainnet launch

#### **3. Lighthouse 2.0 - Expanding to L1**

Lighthouse 2.0 extends good MEV capture across L1 and L2. This unlocks greater value creation for rollups, L1 validators, and searchers through L1-L2 arbitrage.

* **Q2 2026:** Testnet launch
* **Q4 2026:** Mainnet launch
